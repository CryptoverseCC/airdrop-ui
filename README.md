## AirDrop UI

This UI was created to provide AirDrop functionality for all interested parties. Together with Userfeeds Platform custom algorithms it will provide targeted AirDrops for all.

## Setup local wallet for airdrop
To launch an airdrop you have to first have a local wallet with unlocked interface to automate the transaction signing

For example for parity:
`parity --chain=kovan --force-ui --jsonrpc-cors=all --unlock=0x0000005A13B7b781134A74c09d9D72ef00000000 --password=/pathtopassword`
